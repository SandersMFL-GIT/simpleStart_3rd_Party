We are happy to inform you thatyou have qualified for a 20% reduction on your upfront deposit.

This means you&apos;ll need 80% of the initial deposit quoted to have us start work on your legal matter. We won&apos;t touch that money until your case is over. Then every two weeks you&apos;ll pay us for the work your attorney has billed.

If you&apos;re still interested in having us represent you in your family law case, we&apos;d love to. Please contact your new attorney!
